# MPSC
This repository contains the files used for generating and analysing the data used in my MA thesis "Modeling Prosodic Strategy Competition" as well as the resulting data itself.

# Introduction
The main computational aim of this thesis was to model competition in prosodic systems through the use of matrices of coefficients. These matrices were obtained for each system by defining an optimization problem and solving it with the Differential Evolution optimization algorithm.

# Folder structure
The repository is divided in five main folders. The first one contains the data generation files. The second one contains the JLD files where the data generated for each system is stored. The third one contains the files used for analysing the generated data and producing plots out of it. Finally, there is a folder containing all the final plots used in this 

# Data generation files

# General Disclaimer
The code that is shared here is an instance of what is known as 'researcher code'. The sole purpose for sharing it is to make the procedure reproducible and more transparent for other researchers. That being said, the original folder and file structure was not exactly the one presented here, because the relevant files probably amount to less than 5% of all the files and folders that were generated through this project. Practically speaking, this could mean that the directories used in the files may no longer make sense, if I missed them in my last revision.
